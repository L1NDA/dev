A personal summer project done in collaboration with Clare Zhou

Inspired by alternative ways to create to-do lists, we created a productivity platform that organizes to-dos in a priority matrix, as well as a collapsible side bar for notes

The next goal is to transfer this over to a Google Chrome new-tab extension.
